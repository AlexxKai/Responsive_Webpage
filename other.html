                    <p>Beauxbatons Magic Academy (French: Académie de Magie Beauxbâtons) [a-ka-de-MÍ de
                        ma-SHÍ
                        bo-ba-TÓN] is a school of magic located in the Beauxbatons Palace in the Pyrenees in
                        the south
                        of France; the current director is Madame Olympe Maxime. Beauxbatons accepts
                        students from
                        France, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands; and students take
                        their
                        T.I.M.O. level exams after six years of study instead of five. The school's coat of
                        arms is
                        composed of two golden wands crossed one over the other, each throwing three stars.

                    <h5 style="color: red;">History</h5>
                    <hr color="#ffffff">
                    <p>Founded sometime before the 1290s, Beauxbatons has had many notable students over the
                        years.
                        The most prominent are Nicolas Flamel, the alchemist famous for discovering the
                        Philosopher's
                        Stone, and his wife Perenelle. In addition to the Flamels, Beauxbatons alumni
                        include the
                        Flamels.

                        In addition to the Flamels, Beauxbatons alumni include Vincent Duc de
                        Trefle-Picques, who
                        escaped The Terror by casting a camouflage charm on his neck and pretending his head
                        had already
                        been cut off; Luc Millefeuille, the famous pastry chef and Muggle; and Fleur
                        Delacour, who
                        fought in the world-famous Battle of Hogwarts, married Bill Weasley, and received
                        medals of
                        bravery from the French and British Ministries of Magic. Olympe Maxime, headmistress
                        in the
                        mid-1990s, was (despite her protestations to the contrary) a demigirl; intelligent,
                        elegant and
                        undeniably impressive.

                        Beauxbatons participated in the Triwizard Tournament held in 1792 and in the
                        tournament held in
                        1994. During the 1792 tournament, one of the tasks was to catch a basilisk. However,
                        the
                        beast became enraged and injured three of the judges, one of the injured being the
                        headmaster of
                        Beauxbatons at the time. In the 1994 tournament, Fleur was selected as the school
                        champion and
                        finished in fourth place behind the other three participants. During the 1994
                        tournament, Madame
                        Maxime was the headmistress of the academy.</p><br>
                    <h5 style="color: red;">Castle and grounds</h5>
                    <hr color="#ffffff">
                    <p>Beauxbatons Palace is a beautiful castle surrounded by majestic gardens and fountains
                        magically
                        created out of the mountainous landscape, and has stood for over 700 years[1]. In
                        the dining
                        hall, wooden nymphs serenade students as they eat, and at Christmas the hall is
                        adorned with
                        large, glittering ice sculptures that do not melt.[7] It is said that the impressive
                        castle and
                        the castle's impressive castle and fountains are the most impressive in the world.

                        It is said that the impressive castle and grounds of this prestigious school were
                        partly
                        financed with alchemist's gold, as Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel met at Beauxbatons
                        in their
                        youth. A magnificent fountain in the centre of the school's park, believed to have
                        healing and
                        beautifying powers, bears his name.</p><br>
                    <h5 style="color: red;">Reputation and rivalry</h5>
                    <hr color="#ffffff">
                    <p>Education at Beauxbatons Academy was of a similar calibre to education at Hogwarts
                        School in
                        Scotland. Beauxbatons students take their equivalent of an Indispensable Degree in
                        Ordinary
                        Magic in their sixth year, rather than their fifth like their Hogwarts counterparts.

                        Beauxbatons Academy has generally enjoyed a very warm and cordial relationship with
                        Hogwarts
                        School, as even during the Triwizard Tournament the two schools have enjoyed a
                        healthy rather
                        than bitter rivalry; Beauxbatons has won the Tournament sixty-two times and Hogwarts
                        has won
                        sixty-three. In the last of these tournaments, Beauxbatons has won the tournament
                        sixty-two
                        times and Hogwarts has won sixty-three times.

                        In the last of these tournaments in 1994-1995, the Tournament was successfully
                        reinstated. Their
                        relationship with Hogwarts at this tournament was strained due to Lord Voldemort's
                        vassal
                        placing Harry Potter's name on the Goblet of Fire and giving Hogwarts a second
                        champion,
                        although he said the relationship did not turn hostile (as individual students from
                        Hogwarts and
                        Beauxbatons remained friendly with each other and some even attended each other's
                        Yule Ball).
                        However, Madame Maxime returned to Hogwarts for Albus Dumbledore's funeral,
                        demonstrating that
                        the cordial relationship continued between the schools.</p><br>

                    <img style="margin-left: 10%;" src="./img/Durmstrang_escudo_2.webp">
                    <p>Durmstrang Institute (Cyrillic: Дурмстранг) is a magical school in Scandinavia that
                        is notorious
                        for teaching the Dark Arts. It is located in the northernmost regions of Norway or
                        Sweden.
                        Durmstrang, however, teaches students from as far away as Bulgaria. Durmstrang was
                        one of three
                        schools that competed in the Triwizard Tournament in the 1994-1995 school year. It
                        is an ancient
                        school, having existed since at least 1294. Students wear fur cloaks as part of
                        their school
                        uniform, as well as fur hats and blood-red robes.

                        Durmstrang does not admit Muggle-borns. However, it is shown that students may not
                        necessarily
                        share this idea, as Viktor Krum attended the Yule Ball with Hermione Granger, who is
                        Muggle-born
                        and would not have been admitted to his school. In the films, Durmstrang is said to
                        be an
                        all-male school, although in the books, people of both genders are seen entering
                        Hogwarts Castle
                        as representatives of their school.</p><br>
                    <h5 style="color: red;">History</h5>
                    <hr color="#ffffff">
                    <p>Durmstrang was founded sometime during the Middle Ages by the great medieval witch
                        Nerida
                        Vulchanova who served as the school's first headmistress, followed after her
                        mysterious
                        disappearance by Professor Harfang Munter who established Durmstrang's reputation
                        for
                        emphasising martial magic as an impressive part of its curriculum.

                        In 1294 the Triwizard Tournament was established as a friendly competition between
                        Durmstrang
                        Institute, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Beauxbatons Academy of
                        Magic. But in
                        1792 a basilisk got out of control and injured the heads of all the schools. The
                        Triwizard
                        Tournament was then suspended indefinitely, but was resumed in 1994.

                        In 1894, Gellert Grindelwald was accepted into Durmstrang Institute. Although the
                        school was
                        geared towards the Dark Arts, Grindelwald's experiments in dark magic were deemed
                        too dangerous
                        for the students. After a certain amount of time, even Durmstrang could no longer
                        ignore
                        Grindelwald's dangerous studies, and expelled him. Before he was expelled he carved
                        the mark of
                        the Deathly Hallows into a wall of the school, which remained there long after his
                        defeat.

                        Sometime after 1981, Igor Karkarov was elevated to the position of headmaster of
                        Durmstrang and
                        was immensely unpopular in that position and as a result several students were
                        removed from the
                        school by their parents due to his cruelty. During his time as headmaster, some
                        students copied
                        Grindelwald's symbol on their books and bags to impress others, but were "taught a
                        lesson"
                        (presumably in the form of retribution) by those who lost family members to
                        Grindelwald.</p><br>

                    <p>Durmstrang, like Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has a castle, although
                        its castle is
                        not as big as Hogwarts. The castle is only four storeys high and the fireplaces are
                        only lit for
                        magical purposes. It has very large gardens. In addition, the school is untraceable;
                        Durmstrang,
                        like other schools, likes to hide its whereabouts so that other schools cannot steal
                        its
                        secrets. Its arrival by boat implies that Durmstrang is somewhere on the beach, on a
                        river or
                        main lake.</p><br>

                    <p>Durmstrang is notorious for its acceptance of the Dark Arts, and was known to have
                        educated (and
                        later expelled) Gellert Grindelwald before his rise as a dark wizard. The former
                        headmaster,
                        Professor Igor Karkarov, was in the service of Lord Voldemort as a Death Eater, but
                        managed to
                        escape punishment in Azkaban by providing the Ministry of Magic with the names of
                        his
                        accomplices. Lucius Malfoy, another Death Eater, considered sending his son Draco to
                        Durmstrang,
                        but his mother did not like the idea of her son studying so far away.</p><br>

                    <p>The place bears a strong resemblance to Azkaban Prison, both are located on the
                        water, at the top
                        of what looks like a waterfall.</p><br>
