                    <p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a magical boarding school in Scotland. The castle
                        is located in the mountains near a lake. The exact location has not been discovered as it is
                        hidden by the most powerful enchantments possible. However, according to Hermione Granger, it is
                        not far from Dufftown. The spells that protect the castle are classified as anti-apparition
                        spells and Muggle-repelling spells (such as repello muggletum), which cause them to see ancient
                        ruins with a sign saying "Danger, no trespassing" instead of the castle. These enchantments can
                        be lifted by the Headmaster. Most electronic devices do not work on Hogwarts grounds. At one
                        point, Hogwarts had up to 1000 students. The Hogwarts motto is: "Draco dormiens nunquam
                        titillandus" . The translation is: Never tickle a sleeping dragon. Quidditch is the most popular
                        sport at the school, with most students going to watch the matches. Hogwarts also has a choir
                        that sings on special occasions. It also has a very unique anthem.</p><br>

                    <h5 style="color: red;">History</h5>
                    <hr color="#ffffff">
                    <p>Hogwarts was founded a thousand years ago by the four most renowned wizards of the time: Godric
                        Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. They personally trained
                        their students. As time went on, Hogwarts grew as more and more students registered. Godric
                        Gryffindor wanted to teach only those who had achieved feats. Helga Hufflepuff wanted to teach
                        everyone and treat everyone equally, Rowena Ravenclaw thought to teach only wizards and witches
                        of proven intelligence. Salazar Slytherin thought that magical education should only be given to
                        those born of magical parents and of pure descent, not to those born of Muggle parents.

                        Slowly, differences began to emerge between 3 of the founders and Slytherin. Each of them chose
                        their students according to high criteria (which were the opposite of those of the other
                        houses). Salazar Slytherin, however, sought greater forms of selection, wishing to limit entry
                        to the school to those born of magical parents or to so-called "clean-bloods" (he was wary of
                        those born of muggle-born, non-magical parents); this desire brought him into conflict with the
                        other founders, particularly Gryffindor. Tension also developed between the other founders: the
                        once great friendship between Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw fell disastrously, as did that between
                        Gryffindor and Slytherin, and so, divided, the four founders and their houses pursued control of
                        the school, throwing it into complete chaos. Slytherin, in the end, escaped from the school, and
                        the other members, diminished by their loss, restored peace.

                        At one point, before Salazar Slytherin's departure, he built the Secret Chamber, which contained
                        a basilisk. According to legend, he left this chamber for his progeny, so that if an eventual
                        successor (the Heir of Slytherin) entered the school, he or she could open the Chamber and
                        release the basilisk in it, and purge the school of all Muggle-borns. The only known descendant
                        to have found the Chamber is Tom Marvolo Riddle, who would later be called Lord Voldemort.
                        Legend has it that Slytherin returned to Hogwarts years later. He died there.
