                    <img style="margin-top: 1%; margin-left: 20%;" src="./img/Hogsmeade.webp">
                    <p>Hogsmeade Village, or simply called Hogsmeade, is Britain's only fully magical village. It was
                        founded by Hengist of Woodcroft. From before 1714 (when the Edict of 1714 was passed), students
                        from the third year of Hogwarts School onwards were allowed weekend trips to the village.
                        Primarily, students frequented the High Street in the High Street and the High Street in the
                        High Street.

                        Primarily, students frequented High Street in the village, which contained the specialist shops
                        and pubs named after Zonko's Joke Shop and Honeydukes. Otherwise, they kept wandering to observe
                        the infamous Shrieking House.

                        Hogsmeade is a quaint little village of cottages and shops, with enchanted candles hanging from
                        the trees during the holidays. It was also close to the location of the train station used by
                        the Hogwarts Express.</p>

                    <h6 style="color: rgb(58, 191, 224);">Pig's Head</h6>

                    <p>It is located below the main street, past Zonko and the post office. It has an unkempt sign with
                        a picture of a pig's head cut off and bleeding. Inside is a single room, small, dingy and dreary
                        with an intense smell of goats. The windows barely let any light through because of the grime
                        that has accumulated on their panes, and the place is lit by candles placed on the tables. The
                        floor is caked with the grime of many, many years; the barkeep is Albus Dumbledore's brother,
                        Aberforth Dumbledore, a grumpy-looking old man with a beard and a shock of long grey hair, tall
                        and thin. It is not forbidden in Hogwarts rules to go there, but Flitwick recommends that you
                        bring your own glasses; Hagrid got the dragon's egg here in 1991, and admits that there are a
                        lot of strange people in the place. It could be the site of the goblin revolt of 1612.

                        During Voldemort's second reign, Death Eaters smuggle potions into the Hog's Head. A secret
                        passageway is hidden behind Ariana Dumbledore's portrait on the first floor of the tavern and
                        connects to the multi-purpose room, or Room of Requirement, at Hogwarts. It was discovered in
                        1998 by Neville Longbottom.</p>
                    <h6 style="color: rgb(58, 191, 224);">Dervish and Banges</h6>
                    <p>Dervish and Banges is a shop at the end of the main street that sells and repairs magic
                        instruments such as snitches.</p>
                    <h6 style="color: rgb(58, 191, 224);">Train station</h6>
                    <p>This station is where the Hogwarts Express stops every September 1st from London's King's Cross
                        station. Students then make their way to the castle in boats across the lake (first years) or in
                        carriages pulled by thestrals.</p>
                    <h6 style="color: rgb(58, 191, 224);">Honeydukes</h6>
                    <p>Honeydukes is a candy shop owned by a married couple who live above the shop; one of the secret
                        tunnels on the Marauder's Map connects Hogwarts Castle to the basement of Honeydukes. The shop
                        stocks a wide variety of sweets, including chocolate frogs, Bertie Bott dagrees in all flavours,
                        sugar plums and super-fluffy chewing gum, and they also make their own chocolate.</p>
                    <h6 style="color: rgb(58, 191, 224);">The House of Feathers</h6>
                    <p>The House of Feathers is located on the main street, with a shop window full of pheasant
                        feathers. In the fifth book, Hermione Granger enters the shop and buys a black and gold feather,
                        paying fifteen Sickles and two Knuts for it.</p>
                    <h6 style="color: rgb(58, 191, 224);">House of Screams</h6>
                    <p>The House of Screams is considered the most haunted house in Britain. It is named after the
                        horrifying screams and sounds that came from inside twenty years ago. The house fell silent
                        years ago, but its reputation remains. The windows are completely closed, as are the doors. The
                        ghosts of Hogwarts avoid the place, as they say that some very beastly ghosts "live" there. Fred
                        and George have tried to enter in vain. It is separate and higher than the rest of the village,
                        and has a damp, shady, overgrown garden. It is entered through a gap in the roots of the Box
                        Willow. It has a piano, and the whole house is full of dust. It's not actually haunted, it was
                        built so that the werewolf Remus Lupin could enter so that he wouldn't bite anyone on full moon
                        nights during his time as a student at Hogwarts. While on the student body, Lupin used the
                        Shrieking House alone and, from his fifth year onwards, with the animagi James Potter (a deer),
                        Peter Pettigrew (a rat) and Sirius Black (a black dog). There Lord Voldemort killed Severus
                        Snape thinking that the Elder Wand belonged to Snape.</p>
                    <h6 style="color: rgb(58, 191, 224);">The Three Brooms</h6>
                    <p>The Three Broomsticks, owned by the pretty Lady Rosmerta, this tavern is famous for its
                        butterbeer, but also serves other drinks such as wallflower, hot spiced mead, cherry syrup and
                        soda on the rocks, and gooseberry rum. It's a hot place, full of people, bustle and smoke. There
                        are many tables, of different sizes, and a mirror. It has several sections, and minors are not
                        allowed to enter the adult-only section. Shrunken heads forbid minors to enter in the third
                        movie. It was the place where Harry first learned that Sirus Black was his godfather and that he
                        had betrayed his parents, although it was later revealed that this was not true.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h6 style="color: rgb(58, 191, 224);">Madame Tudipié's tea shop</h6>
                    <p>Madame Tudipié's tea shop is a tea room in a side street; it is small and warm, full of little
                        round tables and decorated with fringes and bows. On Valentine's Day it is decorated with golden
                        cherubs and is often attended by engaged couples. The owner and waitress, Madame Pudipié, is a
                        sturdy witch with a shiny black bow tie. In the English version, the place is not called Tudipié
                        but Puddifoot.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h6 style="color: rgb(58, 191, 224);">Post Office</h6>
                    <p>At least three hundred owls, ranging from very large grey owls to owlets, are waiting to send
                        messages. They are colour-coded, depending on how fast the letter you want to send needs to be
                        sent.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h6 style="color: rgb(58, 191, 224);">Zonko joke shop</h6>
                    <p>It is one of the favourite shops for Hogwarts students. You can buy stink bombs, hippogriff
                        sweets, frog egg soap, a cup that bites your nose. During Voldemort's second Voldemort boom the
                        shop was kept closed. The Weasley twins thought of buying it as a branch of Weasley's Sorceries,
                        but dismissed the idea because Hogwarts students were not allowed to visit Hogsmeade.</p>
