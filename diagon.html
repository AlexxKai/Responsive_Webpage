                    <p>Diagon Alley is a magical cobbled alleyway and shopping
                        area located in London, England behind a pub called the Leaky Cauldron. Within the alley are
                        a variety of restaurants, shops, and other places of interest. All items on the Hogwarts School
                        of Witchcraft and Wizardry supply list can be purchased in Diagon Alley. The alley is completely
                        hidden from the Muggle world which is just outside its boundaries. It is very large in area and
                        is essentially the centre of London's magic.</p>

                    <h5 style="color: red;">History</h5>
                    <hr color="#ffffff">
                    <p>The Leaky Cauldron was around long before Charing Cross Road was even planned in the 19th
                        century; its true address is number one, Diagon Alley, and it is believed to have been built
                        sometime in the early 1500s, along with the rest of the magical street. It is a popular
                        historical theory that the second oldest building in Diagon Alley is Gringotts and that the
                        other shops grew up around it. However, there is a possibility that Ollivanders is the oldest
                        building, with records dating back to the early 4th century BC.

                        When the International Statute of Magical Secrecy was imposed, Diagon Alley was hidden by the
                        use of many powerful concealment spells. The then Minister of Magic, Ulick Gamp, agreed to give
                        the owner of the day present in the Leaky Cauldron the responsibility of allowing people to
                        enter Diagon Alley from his backyard. In 1926, one of the shops in the Diagon Alley was
                        closed in 1926.

                        In 1926, one of the shops in Diagon Alley was robbed with the help of a four-headed bird.</p>

                    <h5 style="color: red;">Location</h5>
                    <hr color="#ffffff">
                    <p>Diagon Alley can be accessed from Muggle London via the Leaky Cauldron, which is on Charing Cross
                        Road, located between a bookshop and a record shop. Muggles passing through the inn seem to be
                        "quite unaware" of its existence. Knockturn Alley, an area of obscure artefacts, is an
                        offshoot of Diagon Alley, as are the areas of Horizont Alley and Carkitt Market.</p>

                <div>
                    <h5 style="color: red;">Access</h5>
                    <hr color="#ffffff">
                    <p>The entrance is behind the Leaky Cauldron in a small walled courtyard with a rubbish bin. Diagon
                        Alley can be accessed by touching the correct brick on the wall behind the Leaky Cauldron (from
                        the bin, three at the top and two at the side). The wall first transforms into a small hole
                        which then forms a large archway. It can also be accessed via Flux Powder and Apparition.
                        There may be other entrances as well.

                        Diagon Alley connects to a second, less reputable shopping district, Knockturn Alley.</p>
